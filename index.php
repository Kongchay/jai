<h2>About us</h2>

<div class='section-left'>
<p>
We've got the basics of web development down. We know how to change text color, create sections, and build columns of content. We're going to review those items to ensure we've got a solid working knowledge of them. Then, we'll expand upon that foundation to duplicate the neat little tricks you see around the web, improve upon them, and learn how to create our own. We'll take it page by page, subject by subject, piece by piece.

<blockquote>
<p>
Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is nonexistent. And don't bother concealing your thievery; celebrate it if you feel like it.</p>
